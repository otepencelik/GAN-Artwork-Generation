# Artwork Generation Using Deep Convolutional GAN, Conditional GAN and Creative GAN

This repository contains 3 GAN models to generate realistic artwork paintings.

The WikiArt dataset can be downloaded from the following link (original images should be resized to 64x64):

The original WikiArt dataset is contained in [this repo](https://github.com/cs-chan/ArtGAN/tree/master/WikiArt%20Dataset).

The models in this repository are the implementations of the following papers:

The following PyTorch tutorial was extremely helpful to develop our models:
